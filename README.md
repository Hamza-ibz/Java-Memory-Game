# Java-Memory-Game
simple word-based version of a classic memory game which would normally involve cards with pictures that are laid out with all the cards face down. The idea is (on each player turn) to select two cards (one after the other) and reveal the pictures. If the pictures match the player has made a pair and would score a point. If the pictures do not match, then both cards are turned back over so that the picture is hidden, and nothing is scored. Over the duration of the game, the skill is to try to remember the positions of the cards and create matched pairs.

For this simplified version of the game that uses words rather than pictures, there will be just a single player and the aim is to match all the pairs of words in the fewest number of guesses. The game should have three levels of difficulty based simply on the number of words arranged in the grid, i.e., taken from the small, medium, or large list of words provided in the (read-only) data files (three data files provided called small.txt, medium.txt and large.txt. These files contain simple word lists with one word per line.).

With a level selected, the program will generate and display a square grid of words, with each word represented twice in the grid. During game play, this grid should be formatted neatly. The default grid display should ‘hide’ the words and only reveal them when the User selects grid positions during game play.
